  "description": "The Spark Protocol is decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers, borrowers or liquidators. Suppliers provide liquidity to a market and can earn interest on the crypto assets provided, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion. Borrowers can also engage in one-block borrow transactions (”flash loans”), which do not require overcollateralization.",
