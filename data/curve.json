  "description": "Curve achieves extremely efficient stablecoin trades by implementing the StableSwap invariant, which has significantly lower slippage for stablecoin trades than many other prominent invariants (e.g., constant-product). Note that in this context stablecoins refers to tokens that are stable representations of one another. This includes, for example, USD-pegged stablecoins (like DAI and USDC), but also ETH and sETH (synthetic ETH) or different versions of wrapped BTC.",
